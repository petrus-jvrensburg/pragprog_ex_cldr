MathML Support in SVGMath


SVGMath supports most of Presentation MathML. It recognizes elements 
either in MathML namespace (http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML), or 
in the anonymous namespace (i.e. unprefixed elements with no 'xmlns'
specifier). Elements and attributes in other namespaces are ignored. 

The following elements are supported:

    Token elements:
        <mi>, <mn>, <mo>, <mtext>, <ms>, <mspace>
    General layout schemata:
         <math>, <mrow>, <mstyle>, <mfrac>, <msqrt>, <mroot>, 
         <mfenced>, <mphantom>, <mpadded>, <merror>, <menclose>
    Scripts and limits schemata:
         <msub>, <msup>, <msubsup>, 
         <munder>, <mover>, <munderover>, <mmultiscripts>
    Tables and matrices:
         <mtable>, <mtr>, <mtd>

The following elements and features are not supported:

    - CSS styling
    - percent values in most expressions
    - <mglyph> element - ignored 
    - <mlabeledtr> element: treated as <mtr>, first child ignored
    - <malignmark> and <maligngroup> elements, 'groupalign' attribute
    - <maction>: fallback implemented as described in the spec
    - 'symmetric' attribute on <mo> element - ignored in most cases.
      (Vertically stretchable fences are symmetric if their parent <mrow>
      consists only of items aligned on the axis, and asymmetric if there 
      is at least one child aligned on the alphabetic baseline).
