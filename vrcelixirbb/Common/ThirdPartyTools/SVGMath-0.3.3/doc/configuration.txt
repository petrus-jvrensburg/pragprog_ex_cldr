SVGMath Configuration 


In order to calculate space occupied by MathML expressions, the converter 
must know the metrics of the fonts used to draw text elements. SVGMath
has no access to system fonts: all correspondence between font properties
and metric files is configured manually, and stored in the configuration
file.

At startup, the location of the configuration file should be made known 
to SVGMath. If you use a command-line script 'math2svg.py', it attempts 
to read the configuration from file named svgmath.xml in the same directory 
as the script itself; in the API, there is no default location.

The configuration file is essential for proper operation of SVGMath; 
and there can be no automatic procedure to build it. The distribution
contains a sample configuration file, 'svgmath.xml' in the root directory
of the package; it can be used as a guide, but is highly unlikely to work
in your environment without modification. Inspect it and modify to match
your installation.


1. Overall structure

The configuration file is an XML document in an anonymous namespace. 
The topmost element is <config>. It has an optional 'verbose' attribute: 
if set to 'true', SVGMath prints a slightly more extended information 
when it encounters problems.

Inside <config>, there can be five kinds of elements:

    - <family> - describes a single font family;
    - <mathvariant> - maps one value of 'mathvariant' property in MathML 
      to a combination of font family, font weight, and font style;
    - <fallback> - specifies the font family to use in emergency situations;
    - <defaults> - sets default values for MathML properties;
    - <operator-style> - specifies extra styling for math operators.

The order of elements is irrelevant. Each element type is discussed in more
details below.


2. Font family descriptor - <family>

Any font family used in the input MathML files should be registered in an
appropriate <family> element. Here is an example:

    <family name="Times New Roman">
         <font ttf="C:\WINDOWS\Fonts\times.ttf"/>
         <font weight="bold" ttf="C:\WINDOWS\Fonts\timesbd.ttf"/>
         <font style="italic" ttf="C:\WINDOWS\Fonts\timesi.ttf"/>
         <font weight="bold" style="italic" ttf="C:\WINDOWS\Fonts\timesbi.ttf"/>        
    </family>
    
The only mandatory attribute of the <family> element is 'name'. It is the name 
by which the font family is referenced in MathML sources and in <mathvariant>
alias definitions; it will also appear in the output SVG. 

Inside the element, there should be one or more <font> elements. Each <font>
element describes a single font that belongs to a family. The font descriptor 
should have an attribute that points to a font metric file. Currently, 
two font types are supported: 

   - TrueType - metrics are specified in 'ttf' attribute that should point 
     to a TTF file;

   - PostScript Type1 - metrics are specified in 'afm' attribute pointing 
     to an AFM file. Optionally, a glyph list file can be specified in 
     'glyph-list' attribute: it should point to a file mapping Unicode 
     codes to glyph names, in the same format as in Adobe Glyph List 2.0
     (http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_glyph.html).

Besides the metric, the font descriptor can bear 'weight' and 'style' 
attributes that specify the weight and style of this font within the family.


3. Math variant specifier - <mathvariant>

MathML 2.0 introduces a new method to specify font properties for text 
elements through use of 'mathvariant' property. There is a closed list 
of predefined values of this property that are mapped to a combination
of font family, weight, and style in a system-dependent way. In SVGMath,
this mapping is specified by <mathvariant> elements. Below is an
example:

    <mathvariant name="bold-italic"
                 family="Times New Roman, Lucida Sans Unicode" 
                 weight="bold" 
                 style="italic"/>

There are four possible attributes: 
    - 'name' (mandatory) 
         One of the predefined values for 'mathvariant' property, 
         as listed in the MathML Recommendation.         
    - 'family' 
         A comma-separated list of font families that shall be used 
         to style the 'mathvariant' value specified in the 'name' 
         attribute. Each family in the list should be described in
         a <family> element.
    - 'weight' 
         Specifies font weight to represent the 'mathvariant' value.
    - 'style' 
         Specifies font style to represent the 'mathvariant' value.
 
 
4. Fallback font family - <fallback>

The <fallback> element is used to specify the default font family, 
picked when no font can be selected to match constraints in a MathML 
source. The only obligatory attribute is 'family': it sets a list 
of font families, separated by commas.


5. Default values for MathML properties - <defaults>

The element is empty. Each attribute of this element sets the default 
value for the MathML property with the same name. Example:

   <defaults mathsize="24pt"/>

sets the default font size to 24 pt.


6. Extra styling for MathML operators - <operator-style>

The element is empty. The attributes of the element specify additional
default formatting to be applied to each occurrence of a specified operator.
The operator itself is specified in 'operator' attribute: its contents
is the text of the operator, as it appears inside <mo> element in MathML.
Example:

   <operator-style operator="&#x2146;" fontstyle="italic"/>
   
applies italic font style to the differential operator (&DifferentialD;).
