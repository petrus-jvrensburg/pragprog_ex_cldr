      You&#8217;ve decided to tackle machine learning â€” because you&#8217;re job hunting, embarking on a new project, or just think self-driving cars are cool. But where to start? It&#8217;s easy to be intimidated, even as a software developer. The good news is that it doesn&#8217;t have to be that hard. Master machine learning by writing code one line at a time, from simple learning programs all the way to a true deep learning system. Tackle the hard topics by breaking them down so they&#8217;re easier to understand, and build your confidence by getting your hands dirty.
