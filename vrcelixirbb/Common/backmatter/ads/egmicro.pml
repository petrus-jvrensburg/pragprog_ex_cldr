    <p>
      MVC and CRUD make software easier to write, but harder to change.  Microservice-based architectures can help even the smallest of projects remain agile in the long term, but most tutorials meander in theory or completely miss the point of what it means to be microservice based.  Roll up your sleeves with real projects and learn the most important concepts of evented architectures. You&#8217;ll have your own deployable, testable project and a direction for where to go next.
