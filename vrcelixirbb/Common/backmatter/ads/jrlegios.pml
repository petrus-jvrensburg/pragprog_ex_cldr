      Fearlessly change the design of your iOS code with solid unit tests. Use Xcode&#8217;s built-in test framework XCTest and Swift to get rapid feedback on all your code â€” including legacy code. Learn the tricks and techniques of testing all iOS code, especially view controllers (UIViewControllers), which are critical to iOS apps. Learn to isolate and replace dependencies in legacy code written without tests. Practice safe refactoring that makes these tests possible, and watch all your changes get verified quickly and automatically. Make even the boldest code changes with complete confidence.
