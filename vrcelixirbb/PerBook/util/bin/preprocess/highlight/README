# Read a .pml file, looking for code blocks (these are <code>, <ruby>, <interact> and <result>)
#
# IF a block has a file= attribute, read the given file.
#
# If only a part of the code is wanted (because part= or start=end= attributes are present)
# remove the rest
#
# Then substitute back a highlighted version of the code
#
# Options to the code tags are
#
# file="name"::
#    read the source from the given file
#
# part="xxx"::
#    only include parts of the source between START:xxx and END:xxx
#
# verbatim::
#    don't honor <label> and <callout> tags in comments, ignore START_HIGHLIGHT, and pass
#    <![CDATA[ tags through
