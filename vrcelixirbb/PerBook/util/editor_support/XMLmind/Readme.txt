   This directory contains an addon for XML Mind XXE to support
Pragmatic PML documents. 

   You should copy the "pragmatic_config" directory to ~/.xxe/addon
(or make a symlink from there to this directory).  When you restart
XXE, you should then see a "PragProg Book Template" in the New... dialog.

   You will need to edit the template file ppbook.xml to set
the proper absolute path for the style sheet file.  There may
be a way to make this relative, but I don;t have the time to
figure it out right now.
