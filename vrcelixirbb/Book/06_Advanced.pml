<markdown>
Why do I want to read this?
: You've read some of the previous chapters and experienced the benefits in your own code, sow you're looking to see if there's more to be gained by going deeper into this suite of libraries.

What will I learn?
: That you can lean on ex_cldr for a bunch of other things.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: A bunch of advanced (niche) things that most developers can't do without adding a bunch of unwanted complexity to their applications.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: This covers all the advanced topics. Next we'll close-out by showing how you can gracefully manage translations for user-generated content.
