Why do I want to read this?
: Because you're uncertain about these internationalization libraries that you've heard about, or how they work. You want to get a quick feel for them before committing to reading a book.

What will I learn?
: How to run ex_cldr libraries locally, in an interactive notebook, to solve interresting problems that you have likely encoutered in your own applications.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: Translate variables into a wide range of languages / locales at runtime, including dates, durations, numbers and currency values.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: Next we'll look at some of the structured data that's underpinning these internationalization libraries, to get a feel for how you might simplify your own code by relying on them where appropriate.
