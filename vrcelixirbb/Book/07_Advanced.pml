  <title>What else can CLDR be used for?</title>
  <storymap>
<markdown>
Why do I want to read this?
: You've read some of the previous chapters and experienced the benefits in your own code, sow
you're looking to see if there's more to be gained by going deeper into this suite of
libraries.

What will I learn?
: That you can lean on ex_cldr for a bunch of other things.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: A bunch of advanced (niche) things that most developers can't do without adding a bunch of
unwanted complexity to their applications.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: This wraps it up. Now you're an expert. You've got a leg-up for your next performance
review.

      Introduction
    </title>
    <p>
      In this chapter we explore some of the parts of the CLDR that you might only find useful for
      very specific applications. We recommend that you skim through this chapter, just to
      be aware of what's possible, so that you can revisit it later if the need arises.

      Some of the topics include the formatting of lists, person names, URL route localization
      (for SEO purposes), etc.

      In summary
    </title>
    <p>
      In this chapter we dived into some of the murkier depths of the CLDR.
      Mileage may vary, but if you happen to have an application that has a need for something like
      gender-aware translations, rules-based number formatting or localized calendar UIs,
      then this chapter will have equipped you with a programattic approach for
      tackling these challenges. In the right scenario, this can be staggeringly useful,
      so please sit back, relax, and think of all the countless if-statements you've just
      saved yourself from having to maintain.
