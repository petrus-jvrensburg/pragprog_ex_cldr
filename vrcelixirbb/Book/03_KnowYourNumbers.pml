<markdown>
Why do I want to read this?
: Because numbers are where you'll get the most value off-the-bat when you add ex_cldr to your application.

What will I learn?
: You will learn the ropes when it comes to number formatting for different locales, including for ordinal values, phone numbers, currency values etc. You'll also get a sense for the different number systems that exist.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: You'll be able to format numeric values in ways that boost the UX for your English users, but that can be extended for other locales with a simple configuration change. 

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: Next, we'll look at the second-most common problem for internationalization, the one you'll likely have bumped into yourself: dates and times.
