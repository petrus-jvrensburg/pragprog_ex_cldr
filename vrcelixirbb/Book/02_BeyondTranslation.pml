<title>Beyond Translation</title>
<storymap>
<markdown>
Why do I want to read this?
: You want to get a feel for what other benefits these internationalization libraries might provide. You know they can translate stuff, but that's not terribly exciting on its own.

What will I learn?
: You will learn about some of the standards-based datasets that are used by the ex_cldr libraries, and are available in your own code, including countries, currencies, languages, calendars and units of measure.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: You will be able to validate iso codes for standard entities, and convert them to user-friendly display names. You will also be able to convert between currencies and units of measure.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: Next, we'll see how too get these libraries set up in your own Elixir applications, and how to determine the locale of your users.
