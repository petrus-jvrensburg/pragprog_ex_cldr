Greetings, gentle author.

In this directory, you'll find some template files which we'd like
you to fill in when you get a chance.

The first, ContactInfo.txt is fairly straightforward. We need information 
on your contact details so we can pay you, correspond with you, and
send the boys around if you seem to be deliverying too slowly :)

The second, BookInfo.txt, if needed to set up your book's details in 
the world's book databases. Stuff from this file will end up appearing 
in catalogs, on Amazon, and so on. Never fear, though, you're not on 
your own. If you could make a start at filling in the information, 
Andy or I will work with you to polish it up.

The third is a list of reviewers for your book. As you go along,
you'll find people who volunteer to review the final book. Add them to
the list here so we don't lose them :)

Thanks
