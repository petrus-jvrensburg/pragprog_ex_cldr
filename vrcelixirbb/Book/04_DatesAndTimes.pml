Why do I want to read this?
: You've probably bumped into this problem yourself before, and have solved it with if-statements, head-scratching and frustration. 

What will I learn?
: You will learn about the conventions around date and time formatting, and about the different calendar systems that exists, and how they can be used in your code.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: You'll be able to format dates and times consistently, first to improve UX for English users, and then for other locales with a simple configuration change. And you'll be able to convert between calendars.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: This wraps up the most common use-cases, and you can stop reading here, or scan the next few chapters to get an idea for what other niche problems these libraries can solve for you.
