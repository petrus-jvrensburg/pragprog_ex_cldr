Why do I want to read this?
: As a user, you will have experienced mix-ups around metric vs imperial. Or as an application developer, you will have coded-up some spaghetti for handling unit conversions and formatting conventions. You're reading this because you've been bitten by it before.

What will I learn?
: You will learn that there is a better way to do things than you have encountered previously. It uses a standards-based approach to keep things sane and pushes some logic down to the database, so you doon't have to handle it in your application code.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: Validate units, convert between them and display them appropriately. First for your English users, and then for other locales with a simple configuration change.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: This was a somewhat niche application. Next we'll geek out on the really niche stuff, that's going to give you the edge in your next performance review.
