<markdown>
Why do I want to read this?
: If you're building an application where you have a bunch of records in a CMS, and those are shown to users in different locales, the you want to read this to see how you can do that without writing a whole bunch of custom appliction logic that's going to be a pain to maintain.

What will I learn?
: You will learn how to use ex_cldr_translate to manage translations gracefully, on the database.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?
: You'll be able to add translation support for records in your backoffice / admin interface with relative ease, and then expose those translated values to end-users via the UI.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?
: This wraps it up. Now you're an expert. You've got a leg-up for your next performance review.
